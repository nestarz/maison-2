# A way with your own hands

Did you ever felt something was wrong everyone have to rely on Adobe, or other big companies softwares in order to produce content, in order to design ?
Thousands of students, thousands of schools are relying on for-profit companies in order to keep track with the market demand, with today design practices. How productive you are in comparison to the 20th century, you could generate a car in a click, you can draw and animate in the same workflow, you can design, produce and communicate only by sitting in front of a screen. This seems an ode to creativity, for anyone, anywhere. But do you believe it ? Does this crazy power worth your time ? Does it worth humanity time ?

## How strong and fun can be your practice

Those feelings led me to think I have two concerns. One, I want to have fun making. But in the other hand, I want to feel it is right. This second concerns do not overlap the first, because while eating a wild FastFood cheeseburger is tasty, and cozy, I feel it has a cheat meal. Right returns to ethics, morals and decency. Feels returns to emotion and present time. In the end I want to eat a homemade grown and vegan cheeseburger that have its own taste. And this second concern is why design make a better word choice than art. I want to feel sparks doing things, but I want them acting on my audience.

## Ugly is worth seeing

I want this project to focus on new technologies and like a Noir film, depict the ugliness of nowadays and coming standards of practice. 

AI, where you care more about scraping and pressing a click than the actual issue.
